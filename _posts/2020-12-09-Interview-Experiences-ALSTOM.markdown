## Personal Experiences #1: 

**Name:** Anagha M                                          
**Status:** Selected 

<br>At first, we had a test consisting of Numerical, Verbal, Reasoning sections. The most common topics which I found were Time and work ,probability,profit and loss. It was somewhat easy compared to other placement exams. I followed YouTube videos of CAT coaching by Yodha and then searched for more practice questions on the internet.

<br>Then, after two days I was selected for a Group Discussion round. It was difficult because it was in virtual mode and I tried to speak in the first 2 -3 minutes because after that your chance gets reduced, this was an advantage for me to be confident in speaking. While speaking, be confident and clear. While preparing for GD start reading news newspapers and general topics.

<br>Then, I got selected for the interview. It was conducted on Microsoft Teams for about 40 minutes. Basic electronics core questions like transistor, filter,op-amp ,their design etc was asked. I was able to answer the core electronics questions quite well. Study the basic concepts, they don't check your in depth knowledge, they just check your  understanding of the basic core subjects. Do check Google for basic interview based technical questions on ece that will help you a lot.

<br>Alstom the name sounds like it will be very difficult but it's quite easy. Mainly focus the initial aptitude exam, if your basic core subjects are strong and understand the basics of the topics then it will be easy to crack the technical round ..focus on any 2 core subjects.<br>

## Personal Experiences #2: 

**Name:** Krishna Raghunathan                                        
**Status :** Selected

<br>The first round is of-course an aptitude test. However it is good to brush up on technical questions too because they were asked a few years ago. Referring to sites like Indiabix is good for the aptitude section. Sites like Sanfoundry are good for technical MCQs

<br>The group discussion round was a bit difficult this year because it was conducted in the online mode and that makes it difficult to put our points forward compared to an offline gd. However it's all about our etiquette, grammar and not straying away from the topic. 

<br>The interview process was not as difficult as I expected and they asked me questions about my projects and two of my preferred subjects. Never be afraid to admit that you don't know the answer to a question. Just politely say you haven't brushed up on that topic recently. Appearing nervous might give them the wrong idea so look confident with yourself.

## Personal Experiences #3: 

**Name:** Amrutha R                                        
**Status :** Selected

<br> For aptitude round,all we need to do is practice well. Time management is important,So we have to give more importance to it while practicing. The theory is very basic mathematical knowledge. So thorough practice could help us a lot to crack this section. The questions were from Numerical, Reasoning, Verbal, etc. Indiabix, Adda like apps are good for practicing.

<br> Next, the online GD was a good experience. We have to clearly specify our points. Make sure that the points are not repeated. Please listen to the points of others. Give others also a chance to speak. Don't try to overtake the whole GD. In conclusion try to summarise the main points. Express your ideas politely and confidently.

<br> for technical interview, they started by asking the usual question, that is self introduction. Then they asked me about my favorite subject. The rest of the questions were from those subject, which I mentioned as my favourite subject. The questions were not that much difficult and are from basic theories. we could expect application type questions also. It should we very helpful, if you revise the core subjects for interview. In HR round also they started by self introduction and then they asked few questions like ‘why do you chose ECE?’, and some questions from my resume. Overall it was a very good experience.

## Personal Experiences #4: 


**Name:** NSS’ian                                          
**Status :** Not Selected 

<br>The questions were not that tricky. All questions could be solved by using the simple formulae.    For numerical ability, I referred to 'Quantitative aptitude by RS Agarwal'. I also referred to the sites named freshersworld, indiabix and careerride for numerical and verbal part.

<br>My group discussion topic was National Education Policy. Everyone spoke about its advantages and disadvantages. It was a very good experience.       

<br>For the interview, Questions from the resume and questions related to the company were asked. First and foremost question in any interview is self introduction. After that, they asked me about my projects which I mentioned in the resume, about the technology used and how it works etc. They had asked me to specify any two favourite subjects. Then the questions were from ECE core, very basic questions. I was asked to draw the diode characteristics and to explain it in detail. Questions were also from the communication part.   

<br> You should be well prepared for a good self introduction,then 90% of the interview is finished. You should also have a very good understanding of the projects you have done / mentioned in your resume. Answer the questions with confidence. If you are not sure about the answer, please let them know. I referred to Interview experiences from the sites indiabix and freshersworld for this round.

## Personal Experiences #5: 

**Name:** NSS’ian                                          
**Status:** Not Selected

<br> The test consisted of Time and Work, Profit and Loss etc. I practiced the aptitude part from online websites such as 'indiabix' and learned formulas and shortcuts. 

<br> After getting qualified from the first round, GD was conducted. A group of 8 was made. Before GD we all prepared on current affair topics. During GD, the topic given was 'Is India prepared for cyber- attacks'. A minute was given to think and note down our points. After that GD was conducted and 5 out of 8 were selected for the technical interview. 

<br> Technical round was on Microsoft Teams for about 20 minutes. More questions were from ECE core.The questions asked were from the electronics basics. Just make sure that you are thorough with the concepts of electronics. Study at least two subjects up to the core. 

<br> The mistake that I made was, I only studied the concepts and the facts and failed to look upon their real-life application. So I recommend all to study the concepts along with their real world scenarios.

<br> Next is GD round. The topic given to me was “Is India Prepared for a Cyber Attack”. It was quite easy.. Not that difficult.. General topic was given.. Out of 10 students, 5 were selected for Technical, HR / Managerial round.

<br> The Technical round was conducted in Microsoft Teams. Questions were related to the basics in ECE. They may ask us our favorite subject and questions will be mainly based on that.. Can expect application level questions too.. They asked me to design an Electronic Voting machine using flipflops. Study 2 to 3 subjects thoroughly so that you can answer any questions related to that.. Questions other than the prescribed subjects will be rare.. So be prepared for that. I prepared for the technical round from Internet and revised “Introduction to Electronics Engineering” which we studied during our first year.

<br> Almost half of the students who attended the test got selected to next round, I couldn't even make up-to half. It is because I just bi-hearted the formulas and didn't work out properly. And during the test, I forgot everything and couldn't even attend some questions. Also, I couldn't manage my time properly. I referred to R S Aggarwal for basics, and YouTube channel (CareerRide) etc.

## Personal Experience #12:

**Name:** Anjana Devarajan
**Status:** Not Selected

<br>The first round was the written test and was quite easy. Only basic aptitude questions were asked.

<br>The second round was group discussion and the topic for our group was 'National Education Policy'. Make sure that you use the key words like 'sorry to interrupt' etc during gd. Present valid points and listen to what others say because you might be asked to summarise. 

<br>The next round was technical interview and I was wasn't able to qualify it. They ask your favourite subject and then ask basic questions from it like what is a system, types of systems, to draw FM modulator, digram of FM wave form. They also ask questions related to your projects.
I was really tensed for the interview and my preparation was not sufficient. We hardly had a day to prepare for the interview.
Despite the fact that I wasn't able to qualify it, I learned that you have to be technically sound and prepare for basic HR questions in advance..like introduce yourself, your strength and weakness. It is days of preparation and positiveness that can finally make you successful.
