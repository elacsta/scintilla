## Personal Experiences #1: 

**Name:** Archana P Das                                        
**Status:** Selected 

<br>Learn at least one programming language thoroughly. Have a strong insight of arrays, vectors, stack, queue, linked lists, strings etc. Try to code from platforms such as hackerrank.

<br>It was a friendly interview. Questions were focused upon computer science subjects such as oops, data structures. They also asked questions from my project and from the online courses I have done. It went for about 20 minutes. Two coding questions were also asked, for which I explained the methodology. Just be confident in what you speak and don't blunder.
Questions from my projects and internships were asked. Also, they asked about the online courses that I have done which I have mentioned in my resume. Other questions were from CS. As I am an EC student, the CS questions were from basics such as concepts of oops, the difference between c++ and python, arrays, linked lists, etc. Two programming questions from arrays were asked for which I needed to explain the methodology.
For HR, my hobbies were asked. They also asked if I have a problem relocating. A company-based question such as the name of the CEO of TCS was asked.

<br>Learn the basics of programming. Focus upon OOPS, Data Structure topics. Be genuine about what you write in the resume. And be confident of what you speak during the interview.
Prepare on the projects, internships, online courses that you have done beforehand and include those in the self introduction. This helps you to drive the interview. Speak confidently and don't blunder.

## Personal Experience #2:

**Name:** Sreenidhi P A
**Status:** Selected

<br>For TCS, at first we had a test by NQT on their own platform. The test was of 3 hr duration. The main sections were Numerical, Verbal, Reasoning, Programming MCQs and Coding. Each section was having a time limit and was adaptive (that is, we cannot go back to the attempted questions).  

<br>So the numerical questions were of medium to hard level. Some of the questions asked were from Probability, Statistics, and some common topics like time and work, Profit and loss etc. Then, the programming MCQs were tough for me. There were many questions from DSA, Java etc. And for the coding part, I had 2 questions which will be situational. But it can be solved using basic knowledge of programming. All we need to do is to find the formula for bringing the output for the inputs given. Also be aware of the special cases which will be mentioned in the programs. That’s all for this part. And the most important thing is to manually submit the programs when you are done with it. Else, the programs wouldn’t be stored automatically. So please be beware of this. 

<br>The interview was friendly and went for about 30-40 minutes, and there were 3 panelists, for TR, MR and HR. First, I had TR. For TR, mainly they asked questions from the Computer Science field. The level of difficulty of questions will depend on the panelist. Some questions were, What is the difference between C and C++? What is the scope of a function?explain with example,  What is Virtual class?etc. Then I was asked to write a program for a pattern type question. Then the TR person handed over to MR. In the MR, I was asked about situations questions like, After 2 years, If i get an offer in another company with a hike in my salary, Will I stay with TCS or join that company?  I was stuck for some time and they insisted on telling me to speak frankly. They also convinced me that, If it was them, they would definitely go. But all you need to do is stick on to your words. Don’t argue with them, but stick on to what you said earlier. Then finally the HR person doesn’t ask me much. I was asked about bond policy, willingness to relocate etc. And my interview was over.

<br>So prepare well and always sound confident. Never act shy or stay quiet. If you don’t know the answer, just tell them that you don't know. Never try to guess. It will create a negative impact.

## Personal Experience #3:

**Name:** Anjana Devarajan
**Status:** Selected

<br>At first we had an aptitude test for which general topics but lengthy problems were asked.  I felt time management is important. I referred to YouTube videos by faceprep and prepinsta. Next, we had an MCQ section in which only Basics of C programming  like  basic programs/functions and output questions were asked. Then we had a coding section where only 2 questions were asked. The first one was simple and involved only basic maths. The second question felt a bit difficult. Coding questions are lengthy so you have to be patient and read it with a clear mind and think logically. I attempted my first question however I did not have time to complete my second question.  

<br>And after the results were out, I was selected. The interview happened in Webex. We had 3 rounds, Technical round and HR. The interview was of 15 minutes. I was asked some questions from computer science and some general questions too. They asked the coding language I knew , whether it was procedural or object oriented, difference between malloc and calloc, projects that I've done, new technologies that I know. Then HR questions like - a situation when you felt really stressed and after that so much relief, covid impact on you, willingness to work at a different place etc were asked. 

<br>So, All you need to do is stay calm and confident. Prepare well especially for technical questions. Speak in such a way that they feel interested in hiring you. I referred to the Interview experiences from my batch mates who had their interview earlier than me and google for more experiences.

## Personal Experience #4:

**Name:** Aditya G Easwar
**Status:** Selected

<br>For the aptitude section, most of the sites are good and they almost have similar set of questions. Basically practice is what is necessary. I practiced coding using Turbo C++ applications on my laptop itself. 
I would suggest to concentrate more on the aptitude and the English part because even if you couldn't perform well in the coding part there is a good chance you may get selected based on your performance in the aptitude section. So practice those well.

<br>Basically you have 3 rounds.TR, MR and HR round. The technical round will concentrate on your coding skills and simple questions based on your comfortable language. MR round will bring you situation based questions. HR round is to check your background details. Basic c++ questions like pointers,loops,functions etc and basic programs such as palindrome,fibonacci etc
HR round questions involve Cgpa, backlogs etc

<br>Be calm , be yourself and don't panic. Tell them what you know and don't get tense.
The only tip I would suggest is don't study too much , You may get tense and forget something. So prepare carefully and well.

Some of the questions were like:-
Oops concept with example, How to swap two numbers without using third variable, About local and global variables, Scope resolution operator, Access specifiers
For the HR interview they asked questions like, About tcs, CEO, Number of employees etc.

<br>Prepare a good resume and you should have good knowledge of internships and projects mentioned. And also if you are keeping any certifications like NPTEL, it is good to have knowledge on the course you did.
Say your answers confidently, and if you don't know the answer, say like, you will definitely look into that after interview.

## Personal Experience #11:

**Name:** NSS'ian
**Status:** Selected

<br>Tcs had provided a software called ibm Numerical Ability, Verbal Section, Programming/Coding
3 Mode median, time and work, ratio, time and distance, number system, equations it was okay for me, 3 Indiabix, Rodha YouTube channel, talent sprint also refer previous question papers mostly available in freshers world, face prep websites C, C++, Java 3 One i got all test case cleared
while one only some went right. Difficulty was easy to medium understand basic programming algorithm and try working out in hackerrank etc and look for previously asked coding questions
Naresh IT youtube channel, hackerrank, geek for geeks No Tcs we didn't have GD round but i had attended alstom GD and couldn't clear it. What i learnt was
1. Try to deliver your points with facts and figures that will justify your point of view.
2. Online GD is a bit of a mess  since everyone speaks at the same time and it is difficult to get through and speak your point. So mostly try to start the discussion. And will suggest to have a
trial session with friends. 3. Practice communicating in english.

<br>Technical, HR / Managerial Microsoft Teams 25 minutes CSE core, Questions from resume, I was asked questions on trending technologies like cloud computing. I was firstly asked to
introduces myself along with the projects that i have done. Then cs related questions like which language do you know, and was asked to explain a sorting algorithm and a question related to that. Also my resume had most works related to ece core so they had asked me with
such profile why do you want to join tcs or IT field so my advice is speak in a way that you convince them that you are interested for that job and back your answer with any projects or
courses u did in that field in my case i had done iot internship so then iot related questions were
asked. Then a general question was asked like whom do you choose Mahatma Gandhi or Subash Chandra Bose, in the way they worked in the freedom struggle.
Then questions related to trending technology were asked.

<br>Be careful how you prepare your resume. Whatever you include in that make sure you are confident enough to answer when asked anything related to that. Whatever projects you do, be involved in that and preferably maintain a report about what all you learnt in that project or internship so that you can refer to that to recollect. Also work on communication skills, improve basic english helpful to communicate your opinion.
