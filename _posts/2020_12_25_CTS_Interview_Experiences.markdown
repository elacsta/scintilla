## Personal Experiences #1: 

**Name:** Akshaya S nair                                        
**Status:** Selected 

<br>The first round consisted of easy logical and mathematical aptitude questions that have to do within a time limit. You could not navigate between questions. This test took place on AMCAT platform. For Quants we had 24 questions to solve in 35 minutes. The questions are quite simple. 
And for Logical Reasoning, we had 25 questions to solve in 35 minutes which was also easy. 
And for the Automata Fix section, we had 7 questions to solve in 20 minutes. 
In this round, we had to choose a particular language among C, C++, and Java, and all the debugging questions would be from that language. There were 2 questions, where the function was given and we needed to complete it and for the rest 5 questions, we just needed to correct the syntactical or logical error from the given piece of code. The difficulty level was moderate. The time provided was a major factor in this round. At least try to attempt more number of debugging questions as they are quite simple. 
And finally, The essay writing section (word limit 200 words) [in 30 minutes]. 

<br>The next round, which was the interview round, was purely based on our branch related questions and some basics of programming language. Some basic knowledge about our core subjects is essential. 
Some ECE core questions were:
- What is modulation? Types? 
- Optical fibre and Real Life examples 
- CDMA and GSM 
- Sampling 
- Diode 
- Flip flops etc... 
Some questions from CS were, 
- Oops concept with real life examples 
- What is an Array? 
- Difference between Array and Linked List 
- Fibonacci series programming. 
- Size of char, float etc 
The questions depend on the panelist.

<br>I suggest you study the basics of your core and basics of data structures, dbms and programs. Be confident and only answer when u know it. Speak politely and be prepared with your Self introduction, Projects etc.

## Personal Experiences #2: 

**Name:** Archana P Das                                        
**Status:** Selected 

<br>In the aptitude test, we had questions from Quants, reasoning and verbal. I suggest you go through websites like Indiabix, PrepInsta, Faceprep HackerRank, Hackerearth and Geeks for Geeks for this round. Be thorough with the basics. For aptitude, learn all the formulas, shortcuts, and practice problems. For coding, try to study all the basics and data structures. Have a strong understanding of at least one programming language. Then practice questions. Also, prepare all the questions from the previous year and other slots that would be easily available online. 

<br>Next round was an interview. As I was an EC student, interview questions covered both electronics and computer science. But the questions were simple and were focused upon the basics. Don't panic during the interview. Have a pleasant face throughout. The interviewer was also friendly and it went up to one hour. From electronics, basic questions were asked. Such as what is a diode, what is GSM, define signals, what is modulation, need for modulation, etc which are easily available on sites such as Indiabix. From the CS side questions from OOPS and Data Structures were asked such as OOPS concepts, what is an array, how is it different from the linked list, etc. Also, one puzzle was also asked. HR questions were asked randomly at the middle of a technical interview. Questions such as, Do you have problems relocating?, hobbies, future plan, one difficult situation faced etc. 

<br>Just be confident about what you say. They might try to confuse you with wrong answers, but be bold enough to correct them generously and don't argue. Be pleasant throughout the interview. Have a strong base on the technical subjects. Don't blunder if you don't know the answers. They don't expect you to know everything. Have a good self introduction. Include the projects and internship done in it. This helps you to drive the interview. Have a strong knowledge about what you have written in your resume. Be updated with the technologies. Have a strong insight upon IoT, ML technologies. Be confident

## Personal Experiences #3: 

**Name:** NSS'ian                                        
**Status:** Not Selected 

<br>The test was on the AMCAT platform. We were allowed to take the test anytime between the 2 days allowed. The test was adapted, which means that we cannot shift to the previous questions after attempting it. So always keep that in mind.

<br>Round 1: The aptitude was of easy to medium level difficulty. There were 2 new sections which were the automata fix and essay writing section. The one most important factor in the whole test is the TIME and accuracy. If we do more questions in the available time, with average accuracy, we can definitely pass this round. For the Numerical round, more questions were from logarithms, directions, time and work, pipes and cisterns etc. Don't spend more than 1.5 min in a question. One thing is that for CTS, more questions from previous years will be repeated. So go through the previous year questions from the internet. Verbal and Reasoning part will be easier than Numerical. Then, the automata fix section consisted of 7 questions to be solved in 20 minutes. Although it seems quite ambiguous, It is not as tough as we think. Out of 7 questions, 5 questions will be fully solved by them, but there will be small errors in the formulas or some syntactical errors also. We have to identify, correct and run them. And the other 2 questions will be incomplete. We have to complete the code and run to produce output for all test cases. Try to complete more questions on the given time. Finally, for the essay part, try to write without grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Though it is not evaluated for the selection of next round, it may be considered for final selection to CTS. 

<br>Round 2: The interview round was really not that good for me. I didn’t prepare well for the ECE core subjects, assuming that it is an IT interview and they won’t ask more about EC. But 90% of my questions were only ECE. At first I was asked to introduce myself, then they asked what are the subjects I have in my EC. Then, I was asked many questions from analog electronics, digital electronics, networking, microprocessors, digital signal processing etc. Everything was more application based. I remember they asked about the real microprocessors I know( other than 8085 & 8086), then about mobile communication technologies etc. Then they asked me, What is my view on industrial digitalization ? Then, I was asked an aptitude question to solve. 

<br>I would like to suggest that, give importance to ECE subjects also and know their practical aspects rather than just bihearting the theory part. Also, try to understand the new technologies and their relevance in this situation (Covid pandemic). Last but not least, Always sound confident and admit it if you don’t know the answers.

## Personal Experiences #4: 

**Name:** NSS'ian                                        
**Status:** Selected 

<br>The most asked topics for aptitude are Time & Work, Speed Distance & Time, Probability, Blood relations, Reading passage Questions were from the cts previous question papers. These questions are available on various sites. Therefore the aptitude section was easy for me since I have already practiced them. I referred to freshersworld.com Indiabix Quantitative aptitude by R S Aggarwal. Next is the automata fix section. I couldn't perform well in this section. Questions were a bit difficult for me. If you practice more questions, you can score really well in this section. Automata questions are available on various websites. 

<br>Next I was selected for an interview round. I had a Technical, HR / Managerial round. My interview took about 30 minutes. I had questions from ECE core, CSE core, from resume, Questions related to blooming technologies (AI, ML, Cloud Computing etc), Aptitude/ puzzles, Coding questions and some General questions. The interview started with my self introduction. Then, the interviewer asked me a few questions related to microcontroller,optical communication and about the new technologies. He also asked me to explain my projects, which I mentioned in my resume, in detail. He then gave me an aptitude question to solve, it was an easy question but tricky. After solving it, he asked me to explain the method through which I solved the question. I was asked to write a program on Fibonacci series and then to predict the output. Next was the HR section, where the interviewer asked me a few general questions like how I spent my lockdown days, situation-based questions from real life. Questions were also from the essay which I wrote in the online test. Lastly, he enquired whether I was having my questions or not for him. Overall the interview was easy for me.

## Personal Experiences #5: 

**Name:** Aardra P S                                     
**Status:** Selected 

<br>The test in the AMCAT platform consisted of a quantitative section, verbal, logical, automata fix (coding) section. I referred to Indiabix, Hackerank, Hackerearth for this test. Practice different types of questions and attend mock tests to maintain time. Then, I was selected for the next round which was the interview. 

<br>The Interview started with self introduction and since, I had mentioned about internships, they asked me about that. Then,I was asked many questions from ECE. Later they asked about oops concepts and some programming questions. A program in python was given and asked to predict the output (I had mentioned about python in my resume). Then at last, they asked about hobbies and some questions about the company. Colour code of resistors, Which IC is used as op-amp? Why the IT field? How many employees are there in CTS? and my Hobbies. 

<br>So, I would like to share with you that, always prepare a resume such that you should have clear knowledge about all the details mentioned in the resume. Always brush- up the basics, and try to study any programming language. Be confident and prepare a good self introduction, because it is the steering wheel of the interview.

## Personal Experiences #6: 

**Name:** Risana H                                        
**Status:** Selected 

<br>The first round test was conducted in AMCAT. The questions were from easy to medium level. 
For Quants- 24 questions - 35 mins, 
Logical- 25- 35 mins 
English- 1(essay) - 30 mins 
Code Debugging- 7 - 20 mins 
I attended some miscellaneous online tests and Hackerrank for this round. I suggest you read the questions carefully and understand the logic. 

<br>Next is the interview. It was a good experience. For me, the interview was rescheduled for 3 times. And finally,  It's duration was 1hr. They asked questions from ece subjects,optical communication and embedded systems like What are the advantages of optical fiber? What are the different memories used in embedded systems? What is the difference between DRAM and SRAM? Then they gave some aptitude questions from time and work to solve and a coding to find the sum of two numbers. And then, some general questions like Why should we hire you? What do you know about cognizant? Are you flexible? etc were asked. 

<br>So, go through the sites and get information about the company. Prepare IT subject and core subjects also for this company.

## Personal Experiences #7: 

**Name:** NSS'ian                                        
**Status:** Selected 

<br>For the test, we had Numerical, Verbal, Reasoning, Automata fix, and Essay sections. Majority of the questions for CTS will be from logarithm concepts, but other topics are also equally important blood relation ,time and work are the topics to score easily Indian bix and aptitude questions books. The Automata questions are simple but we should have a keen eye to spot the mistakes. The mistake could be logical, syntax or I/O error so we have to read through each like to narrow down the error. There will be at most 2 error in each question 

<br>And then I was selected for a Technical, HR / Managerial interview. My interview was about 1hr. Questions were from ECE core, CSE core,  resume, Aptitude/ puzzles. Technical questions from both ECE and CSE will be asked. They'll cover the basics of almost all core subjects even from s8. Be frank if u don't know the answer. Try to keep the environment friendly and that might do the trick and yes you'll have to answer the majority of the questions but if u couldn't answer a few it won't be an issue.

**Status:** Selected 

<br>The aptitude test was of medium difficulty for me. I prepared from Prepinsta,India bix, and Hackerank. So, do well in aptitude. Check previous year questions for the coding section. Be confident and prepare maximum for the technical Interview. There were only logical questions like, 
- I need a phone which one you give me? 
- I want to collect the number of coffee each employee consumes in a week in an office of 1 lakh employees. Give me a method? 

<br>I also got questions like, why you need this job, About family members, father, mother etc. Prepare well.. Hard work will pay off. Be genuine and sound confident.. Don't act like a calm and quiet person. Don't bother about how much english you know to speak with confidence.

**Name:** Praveena Unnikrishnan V                                       
**Status:** Selected 

<br>In the test, we had 3 sections for 2 hours. The aptitude was of medium level difficulty. I referred to aptitude from careerride.com and for coding, Hackerearth. Try to cover almost all topics in the aptitude section. Coding questions were simple and are not necessary for clearing the test for a non-cs branch student. 

<br>I was selected for the next round. There was only one interview which includes technical and HR. They asked only about the things on my resume and some basic questions related to our core subjects. They also asked basic programs like swapping of 2 numbers. Then I was asked about the challenging situation that I experienced. 

<br>I suggest you, if you have mentioned about the workshops,seminars etc in your resume, then you should know something about it to say when asked.
